# Progress log
## Week 09-04-2018 | 15-04-2018
- Previous week I delivered my draft for the IPP report. The supervisors reviewed it and provided feedback. I will discuss about the feedback in the meeting this week. I am especially interested in the following things:
  - Spliting the introduction in related work and the thing I am going to do.
    - **The objective of the introduction is to put things in perspective. It is not necessary to split the section, but it is important to clarify two things. The first one is the related work which refers to things done previously. The second one is the background which is related to the project itself. The background should be written last; the objective of this section is to give a clear idea of the project without providing too many details. If the reader is interested in more details he might continue reading the document. So, I think the background also has to motivate the reader to reach the next sections.** 
    - **However, this raises the question about the abstract. The abstract has to deliver three important aspects: crisis, solution and happiness. Crisis refers to the problem, what the current situation is and how this is an issue. The solution refers to the thing that we are proposing to solve that problem. Finally, the happiness is the final result, hopefully, the proposed solution solved the problem.**
  - How to better explain the integration of the game and AnkiDroid?
    - **Here, I will need provide more details about how the integration of the game and the AnkiDroid is going to happen. I explained that resources obtained while using AnkiDroid will be used in the game, but I need to elaborate more on that. I need to provide detailed information about the use of the resources in the game, which means that I need to explain more about the modifications I will do to the game since right now is quite simple and I need to make it more appealing to the users by providing more features.**
  - How to improve the writing since it was mentioned as clunky?
    - **There are some things that I can do.**
      - **Reading distinction masters projects**
      - **Ask a non expert in the field to read the paper. This way, I can make sure my writing can be understood by the general audience.**
      - **Read aloud my writing so I can find things that are not quite clear or that can be explained in other ways.**
  - Skip the Ethics Approval?
    - **This might not be necessary, but since it is a simple process, I will do it anyway.**
  - Explain the documentation is the thesis and the documenting the code. How to make that clearer?
    - **My original idea was to write the thesis as I progress in the project. However, this seems to be difficult and risky. So the alternative is to take notes during the development, and write the actual report almost at the end of project. Eventually, I will need more weeks to complete the writing. Also, I do need to clarify that this is documentation of the project not the programming.**
  - Do I need to explain the technicalities of collecting the stats?
    - **No, actually I explained how to collect the stats, I just need to put a reference in the document to the corresponding section.**
  - Ideas to get more stats from the app.
    - **There are tons of information that I can collect from the app. I just need to mention that I will collect it for analysis.**
  - Paying the participants?
    - **Prefer to convince them.**
  - Analyse reasons when participants abandon the study.
    - **Yes.**
  - Do I need to mention the modifications for the game?
    - **Yes**
  - Do I need to set the dates?
    - **Yes**
  - Some other things

	- **I need to provide some samples about the questions in the IPP report.**
	- **Prefer graphics over text for the thesis.**

- I also asked for advice about the evaluation part of the proposed design. I was suggested to a informal evaluation of the existing interfaces using the think aloud methodology. Moreover, I was also suggested to use 2 or 3 paper prototypes and perform the human computer to evaluate them and find big problems. I originally thought about cognitive walkthrough as my method of evaluation, however, this option is quite formal and aimed to find problems in the details. 

- I am also expecting feedback for another professor who is an expert in human computer interaction. Hopefully, I will get her feedback before the deadline to improve the report, otherwise, I will simply use it as a reference during the development.

- Based on the previous items, this week I will update the IRR report, and will make a first prototype of the app.

## Week 02-04-2018 | 08-04-2018
- Due to duties from other courses, I was not able to finish the report and play with the code of the applications. I will finish the report for feedback by the mid-week. Then, I will be able to play with the code. At a glance, the game does not seem complicated. I have no idea about AnkiDroid.

## Week 26-03-2018 | 01-04-2018
- I have decided the way to evaluate the project. I am going to use a control group that will not have spaced repetition enabled and an experimental group with the gamification feature available. I will evaluate by comparing the results of a final assessment to the participants from both groups. The hypothesis is that participants in the experiment group will perform better than those in the control group. In addition, I will also compare other statistics like the time using the application.

- During this week I will work on two things. First, I will write the IPP report so the tutors can read it and provide some feedback. I also will play with the source code of the application to try to understand how it is implemented and how it can be integrated with the game.

## Week 19-03-2018 | 25-03-2018
- I need to read the references I have found to decide how to evaluate the project. At a glance, I think two references will provide some clues to evaluate the project.
- Right now, I am confussed about how to evaluate the project. Originally, the project should evaluate the engagement of the users. But what does exactly that mean? A user can be engaged with the application, but not really taking advantage of the spaced repetition feature.
- Hopefully, after reading the references I will make a proper decision about the evaluation and provide enough reasons about it.
- I have to compile the Anki Android and the game application (even though I am still not sure if I will use this game for sure).
- Find some literature about rewarding and engagement related to people using software.

## Week 12-03-2018 | 18-03-2018
- I have selected the open source game I will use to integrate AnkiAndroid with. The game is the popular **2048**.
- I chose this game because is simple, kind of addictive (I have spent several hours trying to win the game), and it has way more users compared to other open source games.
- My first idea to integrate AnkiAndroid into the game is to set a toggle button in the interface of the game. This button will allow the user to enable/disable the flashcard feature. When the feature is enabled, a flashcard will be displayed after the user loses the game. 
- During this week, I will search for literature references related to gamification and space repetition. Hopefully, I can find previous work that has
 combined both fields.
- Also, I will sketch the plan for the project based on the due date and the work to be done.
