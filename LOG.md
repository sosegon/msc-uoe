# Progress log
## Week 19-03-2018 | 25-03-2018
- I need to read the references I have found to decide how to evaluate the project. At a glance, I think two references will provide some clues to evaluate the project.
- Right now, I am confussed about how to evaluate the project. Originally, the project should evaluate the engagement of the users. But what does exactly that mean? A user can be engaged with the application, but not really taking advantage of the spaced repetition feature.
- Hopefully, after reading the references I will make a proper decision about the evaluation and provide enough reasons about it.
- I have to compile the Anki Android and the game application (even though I am still not sure if I will use this game for sure).
- Find some literature about rewarding and engagement related to people using software.


## Week 12-03-2018 | 18-03-2018
- I have selected the open source game I will use to integrate AnkiAndroid with. The game is the popular **2048**.
- I chose this game because is simple, kind of addictive (I have spent several hours trying to win the game), and it has way more users compared to other open source games.
- My first idea to integrate AnkiAndroid into the game is to set a toggle button in the interface of the game. This button will allow the user to enable/disable the flashcard feature. When the feature is enabled, a flashcard will be displayed after the user loses the game. 
- During this week, I will search for literature references related to gamification and space repetition. Hopefully, I can find previous work that has
 combined both fields.
- Also, I will sketch the plan for the project based on the due date and the work to be done.
