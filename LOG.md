# Progress log
## Week 12-03-2018 | 18-03-2018
- I have selected the open source game I will use to integrate AnkiAndroid with. The game is the popular **2048**.
- I chose this game because is simple, kind of addictive (I have spent several hours trying to win the game), and it has way more users compared to other open source games.
- My first idea to integrate AnkiAndroid into the game is to set a toggle button in the interface of the game. This button will allow the user to enable/disable the flashcard feature. When the feature is enabled, a flashcard will be displayed after the user loses the game. 
- During this week, I will search for literature references related to gamification and space repetition. Hopefully, I can find previous work that has
 combined both fields.
- Also, I will sketch the plan for the project based on the due date and the work to be done.
