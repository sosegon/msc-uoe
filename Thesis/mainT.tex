%% Load the class. Put any options that you want here (see the documentation
%% for the list of options). The following are samples for each type of
%% thesis:
%%
%% Note: you can also specify any of the following options:
%%  logo: put a University of Edinburgh logo onto the title page
%%  frontabs: put the abstract onto the title page
%%  deptreport: produce a title page that fits into a Computer Science
%%      departmental cover [not sure if this actually works]
%%  singlespacing, fullspacing, doublespacing: choose line spacing
%%  oneside, twoside: specify a one-sided or two-sided thesis
%%  10pt, 11pt, 12pt: choose a font size
%%  centrechapter, leftchapter, rightchapter: alignment of chapter headings
%%  sansheadings, normalheadings: headings and captions in sans-serif
%%      (default) or in the same font as the rest of the thesis
%%  [no]listsintoc: put list of figures/tables in table of contents (default:
%%      not)
%%  romanprepages, plainprepages: number the preliminary pages with Roman
%%      numerals (default) or consecutively with the rest of the thesis
%%  parskip: don't indent paragraphs, put a blank line between instead
%%  abbrevs: define a list of useful abbreviations (see documentation)
%%  draft: produce a single-spaced, double-sided thesis with narrow margins
%%
%% For a PhD thesis -- you must also specify a research institute:
\documentclass[msc, ai, logo, deptreport, oneside, fullpacing]{infthesis}

%% For an MPhil thesis -- also needs an institute
% \documentclass[mphil,ianc]{infthesis}

%% MSc by Research, which also needs an institute
% \documentclass[mscres,irr]{infthesis}

%% Taught MSc -- specify a particular degree instead. If none is specified,
%% "MSc in Informatics" is used.
% \documentclass[msc,cogsci]{infthesis}
% \documentclass[msc]{infthesis}  % for the MSc in Informatics

%% Master of Informatics (5 year degree)
% \documentclass[minf]{infthesis}

%% Undergraduate project -- specify the degree course and project type
%% separately
% \documentclass[bsc]{infthesis}
% \course{Artificial Intelligence and Psychology}
% \project{Fourth Year Project Report}

%% Put any \usepackage commands you want to use right here; the following is
%% an example:
\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{url}
% Merge cells in table
\usepackage{multirow}

\abstract{%
Anki is a software system that implements spaced repetition. Despite its popularity, its interface for Android devices, known as AnkiDroid, lacks the inclusion of extrinsic motivational elements. Gamification involves the inclusion of game elements and schemes in non-game contexts; its objective is to improve the user experience by providing extra motivational elements in existing tools. The present work provides a gamification strategy aimed at increasing user engagement in AnkiDroid. The key difference from other gamification options is the inclusion of a casual game. The project consists of the design and implementation of the gamification solution, the definition and execution of a study to collect data, and the evaluation of the solution. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between a traditional gamification scheme and the proposed one. Those results served as the basis to discuss potential issues in the design and suggest additional work.
