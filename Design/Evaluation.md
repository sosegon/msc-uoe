## Introduction
I created a single prototype for each version of the application using [Figma](https://www.figma.com). The objective of the prototypes is to give a high level overview of the features of the application. Both prototypes share a significant number of features and have the same style. The prototypes can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/RztlM095i1PLDxDfmmOli4EW/anki-decks-screen).

I performed the evaluation to accomplish the following goals:
- Understand the intuitiveness of the design.
- Find potential problems in the expected usage and actual use of the features of the application.

## Methodology
I evaluated the prototypes on paper by printing the designed screens. Then, I performed the human computer approach with a single subject for each version. Here, I presented the printed screens to the subjects according to the performed interactions. I did not informed the subjects the objective of the application. I simply asked them to interact with the prototypes as with any other applications, which means doing any kind of gestures (finger tap, swipe, etc.).

During the study, I did not provide information about the available features, I just encouraged the subjects to interact with the prototypes and to try all the visual elements. The subjects informed about their expectations about the features based on experiences with other applications, and suggested ideas.
