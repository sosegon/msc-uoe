## Main activities
### 1. Define the method of evaluation of the application
This point is critical because the method of evaluation can affect the modifications and additions to be done to the program.
What is going to be evaluated? What is the main objective of the application?

* Is the objective of the application to have the users playing the game as much as possible so they can use as many flashcards as possible? In this case, the comparison should be performed between the original AnkiAndroid application and the modified game. The users need to use both applications which can be cumbersome.

* Is the objective of the application to increase the retention of the users? If so, an evaluation of the users is needed. Evaluate how many concepts they can remember. Two sets are needed: concepts learned by using the application and concepts learned somewhere else (where?). I think this option does not allow as much control as possible since the other source of learning can be unknown. Maybe an option is to set notifications from the application with concepts that are not going to be displayed in the flashcards.

* If the previous option is selected, how are the evaluation of the users going to be performed? It can be done in the same application, or it can be done by paper. Probably, doing it remotely is better.

* The scenario of application usage needs to be described. Also, a persona needs to be defined (it's likely other students will help to evaluate the application.) This will help to define the field of the concepts to be learnt by the users (Maths, new language, etc.)

* I also need to define the number of concepts to be learnt by the user.

### 2. Modify the game to include flash cards from AnkiAndroid
1. Define how the flashcards are going to be displayed to the user
	* Does the user will enable/disable the feature? If so, the user can simply disable the feature, therefore, it is going to be pointless since he is only going to play the game.
	* Does the application display a notification to try/dismiss a flashcard? Similarly to the previous one, the user can dismiss every flashcard. This can even be annoying for the user.
	* To which extend do I force the user to answer/use the flashcard?
	* Is the frequency to display flashcards fixed or adapted to the user's performance?
	* How many times does a concept of fact needs to be presented to the user?
	* An specification of the features of the application needs to be defined to guide the development process and make tests (if enough time).
	* Perform a basic HCI analysis to make a decision. Heuristics and Fitts law.
	* I also need to define a way to provide data to the users and how to gather the usage information.
1. Make a quick prototype of the modified game
	* A prototype in paper to use the human computer approach may be enough.

1. Modify the application according to the decisions made and the observations from the prototype.
	* Check the structure of the code of the game and AnkiAndroid.
	* Verify the dependencies between the components to avoid conflicts.
	* Make an actual quick prototype.
	* Fine tune the prototype. Match the visual style of the flashcards with the game.
	* Make the content of the flashcards flexible. So, I can decide which field (new language, )
	* Perform tests (if enough time).

### 3. Test the game with users
1. Ask for informatics ethics approval. This must be done while modifying the game (is that possible?), so I can start testing the applications right away.
	* How much time is it necessary to test the application?

1. Start writing the report while the data is being gathered.

### 4. Analyse the evaluation of the application on users
1. If the objective of the application is to increase the retention of the user, a quantitative analysis is needed. Here the evaluation is to compare how many concepts can be remembered by using the flashcards and not using it.

1. However, do I need the evaluate the engagement?
