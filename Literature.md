This project is quite similar since it combines gamification and space repetition in a mobile application. It is focused in STEM education. The objective is to improve the motivation and engagement of the learners. I need to pay attention to how they evaluation the application; how they assess motivation and engagement. Since the project is focused on k-12 students, they might be some differences when trying to assess other populations.

They main motivation for using mobile applications for spaced repetition is the number of people accessing this kind of devices. They provide percentages of the target population to backup this argument.

Two ways to examine the effects of spaced repetition: within season and between seasons. They focus in within a single training season. They present known and unknown facts. There are some literature that backup the benefits of mixing known with unknown facts.

Some previous projects has found the benefits of spacing learning new material and reviewing learned material.

Previous work took advantage of SMS in Japan. Students were able to learn English vocabulary.

Mention of common game elements that are used to gamify a service or app.

There are some previous work that mention the effectiveness of gamification in the performance and motivation of the participants.

They used a focus group discussion technique to mantain a good usability of the application.

They have an internal algorithm to define the spacing and the filter of the facts or concepts to be displayed by the app. They have a hierarchy of categories with the information to be displayed.

The hypothesis for the engagement is "Students who are in the group of gamification will spend more after-school time than students who are in the group with no gamification."

The hyphotesis for the effectiveness of spaced repetition is "Students who are in the group of spaced repetition will perform better after treatment than those who are in the acquistion-first-maintenance-later (sequential) group."

They use a leaderboard to engage the use of the application.

The results are analysed using ANOVA.

This project does not present results since at the time of publishing it was still in progress.

In this project, they present a way to measure the effectiveness of gamification applied to studies. The main idea is that they compare the performance when using the gamification technique and when not using it. They also have measured the gain for higher and lower perfoming students. The gain has been higher for lower performing students.

This is an study about the effects of spaced repetition on the meaningful retention of connected discourse. It can be served as a reference or argument to justify the use of this technique in the learning process.

Similar to the previous one, but the experiments were performed on rats. I need to check it to verify its relevance for the project. Probably, this can be used as an argument to apply spaced repetition without the user being aware of it.

This project seems to be focused in the digital natives. Since they have grew up surrounded by digital devices and services, the education needs to adapt to this situation. This study can be used as an argument to use gamification in learning.

This paper make lists of previous work related to gamification. It is a good starting point to find previous work.

They also talk about serious games and the differences with gamification that can be worth to mention since they seem to pursue similar objectives.

The participants are learning words of a new language.

In this paper, they propose a gamification scheme based on points. There is phase to gain points, in this phase the user get points by asnwerting quizzes of the words they have been learning. They can try the quizzes multiple times. The points are provided based on the number of attempts in the quizz, the difficulty of the item. The idea is that by limiting the availability of the point gaining opportunity, players will value that opportunity and are likely to maximize their point earning potential. Then there is the game phase where the users can use the points they gained. 

Users can also set the level to start.

This paper talks about the gamification of Khan academy. The important part here is the gamification scheme used by this organization: Badges, energy points, goals, progress indicators.
