This project is quite similar since it combines gamification and space repetition in a mobile application. It is focused in STEM education. The objective is to improve the motivation and engagement of the learners. I need to pay attention to how they evaluation the application; how they assess motivation and engagement. Since the project is focused on k-12 students, they might be some differences when trying to assess other populations.

In this project, they present a way to measure the effectiveness of gamification applied to studies. The main idea is that they compare the performance when using the gamification technique and when not using it. They also have measured the gain for higher and lower perfoming students. The gain has been higher for lower performing students.

This is an study about the effects of spaced repetition on the meaningful retention of connected discourse. It can be served as a reference or argument to justify the use of this technique in the learning process.

Similar to the previous one, but the experiments were performed on rats. I need to check it to verify its relevance for the project. Probably, this can be used as an argument to apply spaced repetition without the user being aware of it.

This project seems to be focused in the digital natives. Since they have grew up surrounded by digital devices and services, the education needs to adapt to this situation. This study can be used as an argument to use gamification in learning.
